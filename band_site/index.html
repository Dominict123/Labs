    <h3>Favorite Worst Nightmare (2007)</h3>
    <p>Favorite Worst Nightmares is Arctic Monkeys second studio album recorded. This album delves into feelings almost anybody could relate with.
        When disecting the lyrics close within this album, we find themes of self-reflection, relationships, and fame. 
        This album has an indie rock style with faster and louder production.
        These themes are often portrayed from an almost sinister standpoint. My personal favorite song off this album is "505" for its emotional depth.

    <h3>AM (2013)</h3>
    <p>Arctic Monkeys album, AM, draws on a wide range of music stylings such as psychadelic rock, blues rock, heavy metal, R&B, and more. 
       AM is one of the first albums where Arctic Monkeys starts to delve into a hip hop influenced sound. Much of this album covers the 
       theme of intimacy, loneliness, and romance. Within these themes there is a wide range of emotions portrayed from happiness to frustration.
       There are quite a few songs off of this album that I really enjoy, however, my favorite would have to be "Knee Socks".

    <h3>Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018)</h3>
    <p>This album strays from prior sounds often incorporated by Arctic Monkeys. They Delved into a heavier piano styling, something I would 
        consider closely related to elevator/lounge music with a space like feel. The Arctic Monkeys leaned on the stlyes of pop for the majority
        of this album. While this album took a step away from the bands normal sound, they were praised for their innovative sounds while 
        maintaining the depth of lyricism portrayed in prior albums. I have not taken the time to fully digest this album, however, one of my 
        favorite songs would be "Star Treatment".
