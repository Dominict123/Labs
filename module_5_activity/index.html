    <h3>History of Sharks:</h3>
    <p>Sharks have been an apex predator since dinosaurs were romaing Earth.
       With a fossil record of over 400 million years, there are still new species being 
       discovered yearly.
    </p>

    <h3>Decline of Sharks:</h3>
    <p>There are many of species of sharks that are on the decline or close to extinction.
       The growing demand for shark fins has led to an overfishing. This practice does not 
       target solely one species but many and done so with great irregulation. While, the fins and meat
       are often used to make soups, and other dishes, the lack of control has led to endangered species.
    </p>

    <h3>Who's Here to Help:</h3>
    <p>Organizations such as the WWF make great efforts to save the sharks. They work with TRAFFIC, which is the 
       worlds largest monitoring network. The WWF seeks to ensure proper management and countermeasure are implemented 
       by fishery management organizations and countries that participate trade agreements.
